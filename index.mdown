+ Time
+ Scarcity of resources
+ Economics



## Seriously, people...

How great is web development?

+ _Web Classic_
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript

How great is web development _economically_?

## The value of _view-source_

FREE

## Free resources


## Economic environment for development

+ Free as in money
+ Resources readily available

People will make stuff

## Incredible resources

+ Modernizr
+ HTML5 Boilerplate
+ Twitter Bootstrap

Most are free

## Culture of free

Particular to front-end development

### Costs no money to...

+ Learn
+ Use resources
+ Market your stuff

## Side projects are great!

+ Work on what excites you
+ Flex under-used muscles
+ Market yourself
+ Build and promote your personal brand
+ Community gets another tool for its toolkit

## Personal experience with Masonry

+ First released in 2008
+ Linked by Andy Clarke
+ First save on Delicious by Jason Santa Maria 
+ Linked by Cameron Moll
+ Fireballed
+ Percolates in the web community
+ Picked up by WordPress themes, then Tumblr Themes
+ Becomes part of a toolset for the web
+ Used by Pinterest

## Happily ever after?

Beware novice users

They mean well

Contacting author possibly not a last resort

If you trying to implement something, and you don't have the skills as a developer, what other ways can you resolve a problem?

Contact an expert.

Free as in time to do so

They mean well.

"I just can't figure it out."

## Jerkface open-soure attitude

It's open-source,

_you_ figure it out.


## Economics of contacting authors to resolve issue

+ User takes 10 minutes to email author
+ Takes author 30 minutes to resolve issue
+ 40 minutes total
+ Issue resolved

vs

+ User takes up to 4 to Infinity hours to resolve issue
+ Infinity hours total
+ Issue may not be resolved

Individually, each request is managable.

But they begin to pile up.

## Propagation of bad code

The _dark side_ of view-source.

+ User contacts author
+ Author replies with "It's open source, _you_ figure it out"
+ User does figure it out!
+ Whose code is going to be better?
+ Code supplied by the author?
+ Code written by the user who figured it out?

Sloppy code is okay

...unless it spreads

## Filtering code example

### Masonry

{% highlight javascript %}

if ( filterVal == 'All' ) {
  $('.hidden').fadeIn('slow').removeClass('hidden');
} else {
  $('.reading-bug').each(function() {
    if ( !$(this).hasClass(filterVal) ) {
      $(this).fadeOut('normal').addClass('hidden');
    } else {
      $(this).fadeIn('slow').removeClass('hidden');
    }
  });
}
$('#reading-lst').masonry('reload');

{% endhighlight %}

### Isotope

{% highlight javascript %}

var filterSelector = filterVal == 'All' ? '*' : '.' + filterVal;
$('#reading-lst').isotope({ filter: filterSelector });

{% endhighlight %}

## Bad code propagates

Author has an interest in providing good code everywhere

Thus, author should help novice users

But author will go CRAZY

(Helping novice users doesn't scale)

## Managing a successful project

+ Emails for support requests
+ Issues and pull-requests being added on GitHub
+ Stack Overflow
+ Tweets

### Managing Masonry

+ 8+ hours a week
+ Updating docs
+ Adding features
+ Responding to support requests (ugh)

## A matter of economics

+ Principles of scarcity
+ Availability of resources
+ There's only so many hours in the day

## How valuable is my time?

### Instead of...

+ Work on what excites you
+ Flex under-used muscles
+ Market yourself
+ Build and promote your personal brand
+ Community gets another tool for its toolkit

Why don't I put a price on this?

## Putting a price on something

Users have to make a value judgement

+ Free -> costs their time
+ Priced -> costs time and money
+ Something "tangible"

"Is it worth it?"

## Other developers make money

+ iOS App Store
+ WordPress premium themes
+ [Expression Engine Commercial Add-ons](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/store)
+ [Icon](http://geomicons.com/) [packs](http://pictos.cc/)

## Where's the market for front-end dev resources?

+ Never prevent people from "stealing"
+ Because of _view-source_

## Commercial front-end dev pioneers

### Laissez-faire open-source attitude

"Hey, it's open-source. _You_ fix it."
