+ Time
+ Scarcity of resources
+ Economics



## Seriously, people...

How great is web development?

+ _Web Classic_
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript

How great is web development _economically_?

## The value of _view-source_

+ Essential learning tool
+ View underlying elements
+ Universally available
+ Swift exchange of techniques
+ Identify > Isolate > Implement

## Economic environment for development

+ Free as in money
+ Resources readily available

People will make stuff

## Incredible resources

+ Modernizr
+ HTML5 Boilerplate
+ Twitter Bootstrap

Side-projects

## Side projects are great!

+ Work on what excites you
+ Flex under-used muscles
+ Market yourself
+ Build and promote your personal brand
+ Community gets another tool for its toolkit

Most are free

## Culture of free

+ Particular to front-end development
+ Because of view-source
+ No paywall

### Costs no money to...

+ Learn
+ Use resources
+ Market your stuff

_Ideal environment for the impulsively creative_

+ Percolates in the web community
+ Picked up by WordPress themes

+ Becomes part of the visual language of the web

## Happily ever after?

+ Managing successful open-source resource

## In come the support requests

+ Novice users
+ (a small fraction of)
+ They mean well
+ Contacting author possibly not a last resort

If you are trying to implement something, and you don't have the skills as a developer, what other ways can you resolve a problem?

Contact an expert.

+ Free to do so
+ "I tried X. I tried Y. _I just can't figure it out_."

## Jerkface open-soure attitude

It's open-source,

_you_ figure it out.

![deal with it](img/deal.gif)

## Prolly not fair

+ User takes 10 minutes to email author
+ Takes author 30 minutes to resolve issue
+ 40 minutes total
+ Issue resolved

### vs.

+ User takes up to 4-to-Infinity hours to resolve issue
+ Infinity hours total
+ Issue may not be resolved

Individually, each request is managable.

But they begin to pile up.

## Propagation of bad code

The _dark side_ of view-source.

+ User contacts author
+ Author replies with "It's open source, _you_ figure it out"
+ User does figure it out!
+ Whose code is going to be better?
+ Sloppy code is okay
+ ...unless it spreads

## Filtering code example

### Masonry

{% highlight javascript %}

if ( filterVal == 'All' ) {
  $('.hidden').fadeIn('slow').removeClass('hidden');
} else {
  $('.reading-bug').each(function() {
    if ( !$(this).hasClass(filterVal) ) {
      $(this).fadeOut('normal').addClass('hidden');
    } else {
      $(this).fadeIn('slow').removeClass('hidden');
    }
  });
}
$('#reading-lst').masonry('reload');

{% endhighlight %}

### Isotope

{% highlight javascript %}

$('#reading-lst').isotope({
  filter: filterVal === 'All' ? '*' : '.' + filterVal
});

{% endhighlight %}

## Bad code propagates

Author has an interest in providing good code everywhere

Thus, author should help novice users

But author will go CRAZY

(Helping novice users doesn't scale)

## Managing a successful project

+ Emails for support requests
+ Issues and pull-requests being added on GitHub
+ Stack Overflow
+ Tweets

### Managing Masonry

+ 8+ hours a week
+ Updating docs
+ Adding features
+ Responding to support requests (ugh)

## A matter of economics

+ Principles of scarcity
+ Availability of resources
+ There's only so many hours in the day

### Cost

## How valuable is my time?

### Instead of...

+ Work on what excites you
+ Flex under-used muscles
+ Market yourself
+ Build and promote your personal brand
+ Community gets another tool for its toolkit

_Why don't I put a price on this?_

## Putting a price on something

+ Users have to make a value judgement
+ Money is something "tangible"
+ "Is it worth it?"

## Other developers make money

+ iOS App Store
+ WordPress premium themes
+ [Expression Engine Commercial Add-ons](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/store)
+ [Icon](http://geomicons.com/) [packs](http://pictos.cc/)

## Market for front-end dev resources?

+ Never be able to prevent people from "stealing"
+ Because of _view-source_

## Commercial front-end dev pioneers

## All the pieces

## Commercializing front-end dev

+ Not a silver bullet
+ Are support emails bugging you?
+ Think about it

### Scott Robbin

## Re-thinking role of front-end dev

+ There is a huge market for commercial front-end dev
+ Free & open-source ideal doesn't scale
+ Economic deficit

_There is nothing wrong about making money off of honest work._


## Thank you!

## Offering Premium Support

+ Costs $17
+ Customer gets to email me
+ Those who needed support
+ Competent developers figure it out
+ Those who used support didn't just need Isotope support
+ They needed lower level help with JavaScript


## How much is this worth?

+ Isotope development took 12 hours a week, 3 months
+ 14 weeks x 12 hours a weeks x $24 an hour
+ $4,032 estimated


## Pricing

+ Isotope released at $37
+ Fair price?
+ iOS >$1 = 'pricey'
+ Dark Sky app
+ But...
+ Contract developer for this = $1,000's










## PayPal

+ Not friendly across the globe
+ Blocks IPs from some countries in the Mid-East
